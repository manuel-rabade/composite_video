/*
This library provides a simple method for outputting data to a tv
from a frame buffer stored in sram.  This implementation is done
completly by interupt and will return give as much cpu time to the
application as possible.

Limitations:
-	Currently only works with NTSC. PAl support would require modifying
	the timings in video_gen.h as well as the OCR1A ISR to allow for a 16bit
	line counter.
-	each frame only consists of 256 scanlines vs 262 for the fake progressive
	signal this is supposed to generate (works fine on my tv).
- virtical sync does not match the specs at all.


current hardware setup:
Pin9: Sync line:  -->|--/\/\/\--o
				Diode 1Kohm   |
Pin8: Video line: -->|--/\/\/\--o---------------- RCA tip
				Diode 330ohm  |
								o--/--/\/\/\--o-- RCA GND
								Switch  75ohm |
											V
											GND
											
Audio connected to arduino pin 10, hard coded for now
